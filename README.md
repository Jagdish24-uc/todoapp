# React TODO App

A simple offline TODO app for the browser built with React.js.

)

## Key Features

- A simple input bar to add TODOs by pressing the return key.
- A list of TODO cards where each TODO is appended on creation.
- Clicking on a TODO card marks it as complete and moves it to the bottom of the list.
- Active TODO cards appear in order of creation (most recent on top), while completed TODO cards appear in order of completion (most recent on top).
- A reset button on the top right corner of the app clears all TODOs and returns to the initial state.
- Hitting the refresh button (including a hard refresh) in the browser does not change the app's state, making it work like a regular offline app.
